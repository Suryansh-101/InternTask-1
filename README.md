# Student Performance Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of my internship at **CODEXINTERN **.  
It demonstrates how to perform **basic data analysis** using the **Pandas** library and visualize insights with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

The dataset contains student details, including their major and scores in **Math, Science, and History**.  
We calculate average scores, explore relationships between subjects, and visualize correlations through different plots.

## 🚀 Features
- Load and explore CSV data using **Pandas**
- Calculate **average subject scores**
- Generate insightful visualizations:
  - 📊 **Bar Chart**: Compare average subject scores  
  - 🔵 **Scatter Plot**: Explore Math vs. Science performance  
  - 🌡️ **Heatmap**: Show correlations between subjects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 📈 Insights
1. **Bar Chart** → Students perform better on average in **Math and Science** compared to **History**.  
2. **Scatter Plot** → Strong positive relationship between **Math and Science scores**.  
3. **Heatmap** →  
   - High positive correlation between **Math and Science (0.83)**  
   - Negative correlation between **History and STEM subjects**
