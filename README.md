Project Title: Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib
A Python script that uses the Pandas library to perform basic data analysis on a sample dataset and Matplotlib/Seaborn to create visualizations for uncovering insights.

üìù Description
This project was completed as a task for my internship with CODEXINTERN. It serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental data analysis and visualization techniques in Python. The script loads a sample student dataset containing names, majors, and scores in different subjects. Using the Pandas library, it performs essential data manipulation tasks, such as displaying the data and calculating descriptive statistics like the mean score for various subjects.

Furthermore, the project leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a series of visualizations, including a bar chart to compare average scores, a scatter plot to explore relationships between variables, and a heatmap to visualize correlations. The final output includes printed insights derived directly from the data and the plots.

‚ú® Features
Data Loading: Loads data from a CSV format (embedded in the script for portability).

Statistical Summary: Calculates and displays a full statistical summary (mean, std, etc.) for numerical columns.

Average Calculation: Computes the average score for specific subjects.

Bar Chart Visualization: Compares the average scores across different subjects.

Scatter Plot Visualization: Explores the relationship between Math and Science scores, segmented by student major.

Correlation Heatmap: Visualizes the correlation matrix between subject scores to identify relationships.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Since this is a self-contained Python script, you only need to have Python and the required libraries installed.

Clone the repository (optional):
You can clone the repository or simply download the .py file.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

Install dependencies:
If you don't have the libraries installed, you can install them using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Usage
To run the script and see the analysis and visualizations, execute the following command in your terminal:

python your_script_name.py

The script will print the data analysis results to the console and display the plots in separate windows.

üì∏ Visualizations
Here are the visualizations generated by the script:

1. Bar Chart: Average Score by Subject
This chart compares the performance of students across Math, Science, and History.

**
<p align="center">The bar chart indicates that students in this dataset generally perform better in STEM subjects.</p>

2. Scatter Plot: Math vs. Science Scores
This plot shows the relationship between scores in Math and Science, with points colored by the student's major.

**
<p align="center">A clear positive trend suggests that students who excel in Math also tend to excel in Science.</p>

3. Heatmap: Correlation of Subject Scores
This heatmap provides a quick visual summary of the correlations between the subjects.

**
<p align="center">The matrix confirms a strong positive correlation between Math & Science and a negative correlation between History and STEM subjects.</p>

üí° Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with the Pandas library for data loading, manipulation, and basic analysis.

Learned to create insightful and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Developed the ability to interpret visualizations and correlation matrices to draw meaningful conclusions from a dataset.

Practiced combining analytical code with clear, commented explanations to produce a reproducible and understandable workflow.
